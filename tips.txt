CONDA and Stuff

i created a virtual env usong CONDA
conda create --name myDjangoEnv django
which created a virtual env and also installed python and other packages which include django as well

django ENV:-
activate myDjangoEnv
PATH:- C:\Users\Admins\Anaconda3\envs\myDjangoEnv
conda info --envs


When we install Django, it also installs a command line tool called
django-admin


creating project:-
django-admin startproject first_project


__inint__.py Lets python know that this directory can be treated as a package
settings.py - We keep all our settings here
urls.py --  contains all the urls...we have to use regex here
wsgi.py -- this act as web server gateway interface , helps to deploy web app to production
python manage.py runserver

manage.py  it is one of the important file, we are going to use it a lot

python manage.py runserver -- runs the dev server
you have 14 unapplied migration(s). Your project may not work properly until you apply the migrations for app(s): admin, auth, contentty
pes, sessions.

A migration is related to databases
A migration allows us to move databases from one design to another and its reversible...for example...adding or removing a column


Django Apps....we generally create many django apps which we can plugged together or plug into other django projects
python manage.py startapp first_app

  views.py ->
  model.py ->



We can add an include function and make it call a new url.py which we will make in app
